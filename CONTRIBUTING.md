Contributing to the SDK
=======

**Note, the SDK should use REST verbs, (`get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`) as method names.**

Follow these steps to add a new sub-library to the SDK:

- [ ] Add your client library logic (see existing files in `test/sdk/` for more exaples).

- [ ] test your client library by writing integration tests in the nodeapi that consume it (see `nodeapi/test/CONTRIBUTING.md`)
